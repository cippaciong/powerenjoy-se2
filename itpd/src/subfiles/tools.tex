\section{Tools and Test Equipment Required}
Since the beginning of this project we never force the adoption of any specific
programming language or software solution. In this section we will describe the
required tools on a point of view of the functionalities they should provide.
In the end we will provide some examples for a couple of programming languages
but they should be taken for what they are, examples.
The first tool we need is a good \texbf{integration test framework}
providing a full set of functionalities. This should include mocks and
and tools to perform integration testing with ease.
Examples in this direction for Java would be Arquillian for Integration testing
and Mockito for mocks.
Similarly, the same could be achieved in Ruby with Rspec.
The second tool is a \texbf{behaviour test framework} to test web components automatically
without any manual intervention.
Examples in this sense would be Cucumber+Selenium for Java and Capybara for Ruby
