\section{Integration strategy}

\subsection{Entry criteria}
% Specify the criteria that must be met before integration testing of specific elements may begin (e.g. functions must have been unit teste)
There are some conditions on the project development that must be met before starting the integration testing. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Requirements Analysis and Specification Document} and the \textit{Design Document} must have been written, in order to have a complete picture of the interactions between the different components of the system and their functionalities.
	\item All the functions and individual modules have already been tested through a unit testing process and all unit test bugs have been fixed.
	% dobbiamo aggiungere anche le percentuali di completamento che ogni componente deve avere prima di iniziare l'integration testing??
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Elements to be Integrated}
% Identify the components to be integrated, refer to your design document to identify such components in a way that is consistent with your design


\subsection{Integration Testing Strategy}
% Describe the integration testing approach (top-down, bottom-up, functional groupings, etc.) and the rationale for the choosing that approach.
