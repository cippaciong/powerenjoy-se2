\subsection{Purpose and Scope}
This is the Integration Test Plan Document (ITPD). This document aims at describing the plan to accomplish the integration testing of the components that compose the PowerEnJoy application.
Integration testing is the intermediate task between the unit testing, that tests sections of code and individual modules, and the system testing, that tests the complete system.
The purpose of this level of testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units.
