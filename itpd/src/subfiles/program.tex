\section{Program Stubs and Test Data Required}

% Based on the testing strategy and test design, identify any program stubs or special test data required for each integration step

As we have explained before, we adopted a bottom-up strategy for the integration testing: we have tested integrations starting from the low level components, so that the testing for higher component is easier. Furthermore, our architecture is buil using microservices, that by definition operate independently from each other. In that way, as it is built our architecture, we don't need any `stubs' or `drivers', which are temporary dummy programs that replace uncompleted functionalities or components.
