\section{List of issues}
In this chapter we are going to identify and describe issues and critical aspets that we found during our inspection activity.

\subsection{Naming Conventions}

All naming convenctions are respected.

\subsection{Indentation}

\issue[9]{Tabs}
	Four spaces are consistently used to indent except at line 208, where there is a tab.

\subsection{Braces}

\issue[10]{Bracing style}
	The ``Kernighan and Ritchie'' style is consistently used.

\issue[11]{If with one statement}
	At line 61 there is an if with only one statement that isn't surrounded by curly braces:
	\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\small\ttfamily,columns=fullflexible]
	if (userLogin == null) return;
	\end{lstlisting}
	Instead it's better to use this style:
	\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\small\ttfamily,columns=fullflexible]
	if (userLogin == null) {
		return;
	}
	\end{lstlisting}
