\section{Assigned classes}
In this chapter we are going to state the classes assigned to us for the code inspection activity. \\
In particular, there is only one java class which we are going to analyze: that is \textbf{VisitHandler.java}, located in the following file \textit{``../apache-ofbiz-16.11.01/framework/webapp/src/main/java/org/apache/\\ofbiz/webapp/stats/VisitHandler.java''} from a release of the \textbf{Apache OFBz project}.\\
Apache OFBz is an open source product for the automation of enterprise processes that includes framework component and business applications for ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and other business-oriented functionalities.\\

Here are the four methods contained in the \textbf{VisitHandler} class:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{setUserLogin (HttpSession session, GenericValue userLogin, boolean userCreated)}, line 61
	\item \texttt{getVisitId(HttpSession session)}, line 99
	\item \texttt{getVisit(HttpSession session)}, line 78
