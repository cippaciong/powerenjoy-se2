\subsection{Product perspective}
As we said in the introduction of this document, we are not going to discuss the possibile
implementations that could be adopted to solve the customer needings. Nontheless we think
is important to provide some sketches showing how we think the user experience should be.
Specifically, we want users to be able to access the platform from a mobile device and to 
easly look for and reserve cars near the their location.
For such purpose we show some mockups of a possibile application interface.
 
\subsubsection{User interface}
We are going to use a webapp interface as a sample of how the interaction should happen.
Additionally we will show an example of the car screen displaying some useful informations.
