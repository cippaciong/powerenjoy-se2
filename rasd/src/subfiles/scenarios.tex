\subsection{Registration and log in}
 
\Scen{Guest (Tommaso)}{
	Tommaso has seen an advertisement of “PowerEnJoy”, a new car-sharing service that exclusively employs electric cars. So he decides to sign up, because he think that this service could be useful for him.
    He access the site and clicks on the “sign up” button and fills out the form with the information needed for the registration (name, surname, address, e-mail, mobile phone number, driving license number, credit card number), check the checkbox “I have read and agree to PowerEnJoy Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.” and he confirms.
    However he makes a mistake in the credit card number, so an error message is displayed and Tommaso is brought back to the page where the registration form is shown. Tommaso insert all data for the second time and then clicks on “confirm”.
    The system confirms his registration, redirects Tommaso on the log in page and sends him an e-mail containing his credentials (username and password).
    Tommaso inserts his credentials and the log in page is refreshed to the user personal profile page.
    Now he wants to see the list of his previous rides, so he clicks on “My rides” on the top of the page: the list is obviously empty because he has just registered to the system.

	The system search for available cars within 100 meters from her current location.
	Unluckily there are no available cars in the specified area, so an apologize message is displayed and she is redirected to the previous page (reservation page). 
	She ticks “Use my current position” again and insert 500 meters as new maximum distance value and clicks on “Search cars”. 
	This time, the system shows a list of available cars specifying for each of them the license plate number, the make, the model and the location.

\subsection{Ride}

\Scen{Registered user (Tommaso)}{
	Tommaso is driving a PoewrEnjoy car and his girlfriend, who sits next to him, is looking outside the window. In the seats behind there are two Tommaso’s friends, that are singing. They are going to a birthday party.
	When they are close to the place of the party, Tommaso looks to the screen of the car, where there is displayed the cost of the ride within this moment, the level of the battery of the car and a map. In the map are highlighted the safe areas (PowerEnJoy parking areas) and the power grid stations (PowerEnJoy parking area where the car can be re-charged). Tommaso notices that there is only a power grid station at 5 minutes walking from the party place. 
	He could enter in the power grid station or park in the car parking in front of the party place, which is not owned by PowerEnJoy. Tommaso knows that if he parks in the power grid station he receive a 30\% discount on the cost of the ride, otherwise he will pay 80\% more. So he decides to park in the power grid station, although the protests of his friends .
	As soon as Tommaso and his friends get off the car, it locks and Tommaso takes care of plugging the car into the power grid and they go to the party.
	Five minutes later, Tommaso receives an e-mail with the details of his last ride: the amount is 12,60€ (1,26€), but the system applies a discount of 10\% of 12,60€ (3,78€) because he takes more than one passenger onto the car and a discount of 30\% of 12,60€ because he parks in a power grid station and he plugs the car into the power grid. So he has a total discount of 5,04€ and he pays 7,56€.
	He open his bank site and check on his account: the automatic payment has been successful.
