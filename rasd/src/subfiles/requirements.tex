\subsection{Geneal Assumptions}
This are some geneal assumptions that we considered to be always valid when defining our model.
They are listed in this generic list beacause they are essential to fullful the majority
of the goals described in the following section. For this reason we preferred to list all
of them here rather then repeat them multiple times.

\begin{itemize}
    \item{All the cars and the users' devices are equipped with a GPS system}
    \item{The GPS system provides accurate and correct informations}
    \item{The devices used by the users have a mobile internet connection}
    \item{Every car is connected to a network (internet or local)
            and we can send or retrieve informations in any moment}
    \item{We can control some phisical devices of the care remotely, like the locking system}
\end{itemize}
