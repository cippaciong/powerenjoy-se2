		\begin{block}{Introduction}
			The task we are asked to complete is the definition of a \textbf{software system to manage a car sharing
			service composed by electric cars}. This is going to be a brand new system without any
			legacy software or data to deal with. The idea is that users can register to our platform
			using an internet connected device (computer, smartphone, etc.) and then they are able to
			look for available cars in a certain area. 
			One of the available cars can be reserved and picked up in not more then one hour; at that
			point the user is billed for the time he's using the car.
			Finally, the system can apply discounts or penalties.
