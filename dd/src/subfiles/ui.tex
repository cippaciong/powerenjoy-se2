\section{User Interface Design}
In the following pages there are some mockups representing how the application and the car screen interfaces will look like. \\
In the RASD document we have already provided some mockups in order to show the general and essential structure of the most important pages.
We now want to show how our application will really be.\\
\\
We represented the mobile application pages of the main opeations and the car screen, but we don't represent the interface of the website pages because they're similar to the mobile application pages.
