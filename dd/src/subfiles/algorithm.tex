\section{Algorithm Design}
Although our application holds many point of complexity we don't think any of them
is relevant with respect to algorithm design. Almost all operations requires trivial
algorithms, also thanks to the fact that we delegate the distances or routes computing
to an external system. 
The real complexity of our system resides in how to handle all the different components, or
how to ensure that important data are made persistent but again, we didn't find anything worth
noting from the point of view of algorithms.
