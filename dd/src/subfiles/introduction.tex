\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
This document describes the architecture underlying PowerEnJoy,
starting from the specifications and requirements described in the RASD document.
We are going to describe our choices about software and hardware.
Software components, will be presented showing relations and interactions between them,
as well as architectural styles and patterns chosen. Hardware architecture will be presented
showing how the software will be deployed on it.
We will use UML diagrams in increasing detail as a standard language to explain concepts.
 
\subsection{Scope}
This document provides additional and more detailed information extending what has been presented in the RASD,
but from a different point of view. For this reason, the Design Document and the RASD 
document developed earlier have to be both considered in order to have a general view of our project 
in all its aspects. 
The intended audience of this specification include project managers, but above all software developers 
that may use or extend our application in the future.
